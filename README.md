## Tech Freak: Explore, Buy, Manage

**1. Project Description:**

Tech Freak is a **real-world project** showcasing a fully functional e-commerce web application built with modern web technologies. Users can browse, purchase (using simulated payment processing), and manage their orders for a wide range of tech-related products.

**2. Local Development Setup (Optional):**

* **Prerequisites:** Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.
* **Fork the project:** Fork this repository on your preferred version control platform (e.g., GitHub).
* **Clone the forked repository:** Clone your fork to your local machine.
* **Install dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) to install all required dependencies.
* **Stripe Testing:** For **demonstration purposes only**, you can follow Stripe's testing guidelines [https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode) to configure simulated payments. **Important:** This project is not intended for real-world transactions and does not handle real money.

**3. Recommended Development Environment:**

It's recommended to use a **codespace** provided by your preferred cloud provider (e.g., GitHub Codespaces) instead of the manual local setup described above. This offers a pre-configured environment with all dependencies already installed, simplifying the development process.

**4. Usage:**

**Accessing the application: Once set up, access the application through localhost (requires running the development server)**.

**5. Features:**

* **Comprehensive Product Browsing:** Explore a diverse selection of tech products across various categories like laptops, smartphones, monitors, headphones, and accessories.
* **User Management:**
    * **Sign-up and Login:** Create a new account or log in to your existing account using secure authentication.
    * **Forgot Password:** Recover your account access by requesting a password reset link.
    * **Reset Password:** Set a new password using the provided reset link.
    * **User Dashboard:** Manage your account settings from the personalized dashboard. This includes:
        * Changing your account name.
        * Deleting your account (subject to confirmation).
        * Confirming your account email address.
* **Simulated Payment Processing:** This project demonstrates the integration of a payment gateway (Stripe) using **testing mode** for educational purposes only. **No real-world transactions are processed, and no real money is involved.**
* **Email Notifications:** Stay informed with automated emails sent for:
    * Order confirmation upon successful purchase simulation.
    * Password reset instructions when requested.
    * Account confirmation reminder (optional).
* **Shopping Cart Management:** Add desired products to your cart, manage quantities, and proceed to checkout seamlessly.

**6. Important Note:**

This project is intended solely for **demonstration and portfolio purposes**. It **does not handle real-world transactions** and should not be used in a production environment.
